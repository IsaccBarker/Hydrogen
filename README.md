# Hydrogen
Boron is a complete build system that takes in a Lua configure file to generate a dependency graph for building.

## Install
Like basically every single Rust project in existence, Hydrogen is built with cargo. To install, please clone the repository, get the newest Rust version with rustup, download cargo, and run `cargo build --release`. Then run `sudo cargo install` to install Hydrogen.

## Using Hydrogen
Please check out the [docs](https://hydrobuild.netlify.app) (generously hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com)). I've tried to make them comprehensive, along with including some tutorials.
