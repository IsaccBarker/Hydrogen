# Hydrogen

## Welcome 
Welcome to the Hydrogen documentation. I am the only person currently developing Hydrogen on my own, and for my own use (with the exception of CATnet, coming soon), so don't have a need for formal documentatation. However, if Hydrogen takes off, then it will be nice to have.
I try to include real code snippets, along with explanations so you can learn Hydrogen faster, and start writting code earlier.
If you have any sugestions, please submit an Issue on Github.
